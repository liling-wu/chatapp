Here's a quick summary of what we discussed:\nMain issue: Uneven sauce distribution, with some pizzas getting too much sauce in certain areas and too little in others.\nPotential causes: Sensor misalignment, nozzle clogging, pump pressure issues, or flow calibration problems.\nRecommended steps:\na. Inspect and clean the nozzle and sensor.\nb. Test the pump for consistent pressure.\nc. Check and adjust the flow regulator based on sauce consistency.\nDoes that sound about right?
